# React Native London Conf 2024 Workshop: Legend State

This workshop teaches developers how to build high performance React Native apps using Legend State, starting with basic state management and progressing through advanced patterns.

The workshop then shows how to make the app production-ready with features like offline support, backend integration, and multi-user capabilities. By the end, developers will know how to build robust applications that work seamlessly across devices and network conditions.

# How to use this repo

1. Checkout this repo and open the `expo-app` folder. You'll start working on the main branch.
2. Start at the first lesson by opening up the file in the `lessons` folder starting with 01-.
3. Do the rest of the modules in order.

# Prerequisites

- Node 18, 20 or 22 (LTS)
- Visual Studio Code or another code editor
- Expo Go on your device or simulator
- Web browser

There is no need to have your native dev environment set up for this workshop: all the exercises can be completed with Expo Go and your favorite web browser.

# Folders

- `lessons`: This folder contains all of the .md files for the lessons
- `expo-app`: This is the folder you will be working out of to run the project along with the lessons
- `keel-backend`: This folder is the backend that powers the sync features using [Keel](https://www.keel.so). It is deployed to my account for use in the workshop, but the code is here for reference and in case you want to run it locally or create your own instance. See the `todo.keel` for the model which defines the shape of the `Todo` interface and the actions which the app uses.
